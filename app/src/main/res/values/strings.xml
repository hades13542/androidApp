    <string name="Bhaal">Bhaal (pronounced Beh-HAHL)[1], the Lord of Murder, was a god of death who favored murders that were carried out through violent or ritualistic means.[6] Originally a mortal of Toril, Bhaal ascended to godhood along with Bane, the Lord of Tyrants, and Myrkul, the Lord of the Dead. The trio took on the portfolio of the ancient deity Jergal, and came to be known as the Dead Three.[4] Gugari worshipers knew Bhaal as Niynjushigampo.[7]
The Lord of Murder was feared throughout all of Faerûn—especially on the island realm of the Moonshaes.[8] Despite this shared dread throughout the Realms, the exact nature of what the Lord of Murder had power over was contested among sages and scholars—in his best incarnation he might have taken strength in violently punishing murderers and warmongers. Challengers of this notion insisted that he judged whether a murder was righteous or not.[citation needed] Yet another ideal was propagated by the Bhaalspawn, his half-mortal children who had been spawned on Toril, who insisted that he simply wanted more murder.[9]</string>
    <string name="Moradin">Moradin (pronounced: /ˈmɔːrɑːdɪn/ MOR-a-din[24] or: /ˈmɔːrədɪn/ MOR-uh-din[8]) was the lawful good god of the dwarves and the chief deity in their pantheon. A harsh but fair judge, he was strength and force of will embodied. Moradin inspired dwarven inventions and constantly sought to improve that race, encouraging their good nature, intelligence, and harmonious existence with other good races while battling their pride and isolationist tendencies. Moradin\'s holy day was on the crescent moon and he was worshipped at forges and hearths.</string>
    <string name="Mystra">Mystra (pronounced: /ˈmɪstrɑː/ MISS-trah[2][11][12]), the Mother of all Magic, was a greater deity[2] and the second incarnation of the goddess of magic after her predecessor Mystryl sacrificed herself to protect the Weave from Karsus\'s Folly.[9] Mystra was destroyed by Helm when she defied the will of Ao the overgod and attempted to leave the Prime Material Plane during the Time of Troubles.[7] At the conclusion of the Godswar, Ao offered the position of Goddess of Magic to the wizard Midnight,[13] who reluctantly accepted and took Mystra\'s name in order to smooth the transition after so much chaos.[5]</string>
    <string name="Shar">Shar (pronounced: /ˈʃɑːr/ SHAHR[24][15]), the Mistress of the Night, was the goddess of darkness and the caverns of Faerûn, as well as a neutral evil greater deity. Counterpart to her twin Selûne, she presided over caverns, darkness, dungeons, forgetfulness, loss, night, secrets, and the Underdark.[citation needed] Among her array of twisted powers was the ability to see everything that lay or happened in the dark. Shar\'s symbol was a black disk with a deep purple border.[7] Shar was also the creator of the Shadow Weave, which was a counterpart and attack upon the Weave, controlled by Mystryl and her successors, before both of the Weaves fell into ruin during the Spellplague.[25]</string>
